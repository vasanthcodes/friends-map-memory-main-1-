The way you looked at the ocean that evening, Your wet and beautiful hair, the peaceful smile on your face.I swear to god that smile is h=therapy bro- I captured all those moments in my heart (mental pictures). From carrying those bags for which i loved, begging you to go out with me, feeding you,to finding the perfect spot, every second with you in Goa felt like a dream I never wanted to wake up from.",
    rightNote: "Thank you for taking me to paradise, for showing me what peace truly feels like, for singing with me under the stars. Goa will forever be 'our place' - the beach where I didnt just carry you, but found pieces of ourselves in each other's company. I love how free and happy you made me feel there. we will definitely visit again and many more places to write our own stories . I hope really hope and will try my level best to give you what you gave me, i think i took a lot from you but dont worry i will give you back even more❤️😊. A very Happy birthday once again ma, you mean so much to me so much ante so so so muuccchhh♾️♾️",

I will always keep the memories that we made, the photos that we took, the mental pictures that i took close to my heart.I think i knew the moment i talked that we gonna have something special. Oh god i have so many things to thank you for, strating with how you make me a better person, You didnt even have to do anything for that you know, you were just being yourself. and remember that your existence made me a better person in so many ways you have no idea. I learned what it means to care for someone, i learned how nothing matters if that person asks you for soemthing, you just do it. period.",

I want to. I really do. Wherever you feel alone remember this 70 somewhat kgs body and heart is always with you. I am so so grateful that you are born rohini like seriously means a lot to me and somehow out of billions of possibilities we still met😮 and i think thats for a reason. ive always felt that i will not find anyone in my life ever like this but you appeared out of nowhere. I will always keep you close to my heart ❤️ through the songs you made me listen and the ocean you took me to. I have so other things to write about but i will save them for later otherwise as you said you may get bored of me. lol. 😭😭",
